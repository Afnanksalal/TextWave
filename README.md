### üöÄ Getting Started with TextWave

Before you use TextWave, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* **Git:** For cloning the TextWave repository. [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
* **Python 3.8+:** The programming language powering TextWave. [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
* **Redis:** An in-memory data store used for rate limiting. [https://redis.io/](https://redis.io/)
* **MySQL:** A relational database for storing project-related data. [https://www.mysql.com/](https://www.mysql.com/)
* **FFmpeg:**  A powerful, open-source multimedia framework used to record, convert, and stream audio and video files. [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  
Now, let's get TextWave up and running:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to download the TextWave source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Afnanksalal/TextWave.git
```

#### 2. Set Up the Backend (Flask)

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd textwave/backend
```

* **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in this directory and populate it with your Redis configuration details:

   ```
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
   REDIS_SSL=True
   ```

* **Install Dependencies:**  Use pip to install the necessary Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Important:** During the installation, if you encounter any errors related to `unidic`, install it separately using:

   ```bash
   python -m unidic download
   ``` 
* **Download OpenVoice Checkpoint:**  
   - Download the checkpoint file from: [https://myshell-public-repo-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/openvoice/checkpoints_v2_0417.zip](https://myshell-public-repo-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/openvoice/checkpoints_v2_0417.zip)
   - Extract the contents and place the `checkpoint` directory in the root of your `backend` folder.

* **Launch the Backend:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   By default, your Flask app will usually start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Note this URL, as you'll need it for the frontend.

#### 3. Configure the Frontend (Django)

Change directories to the frontend:

```bash
cd ../frontend 
```

* **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install django django-cors-headers mysqlclient 
   ```
* **Database Settings:** Open the `settings.py` file.  Within the `DATABASES` dictionary, update the settings for the 'default' connection to match your MySQL credentials:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'your_database_name',
           'USER': 'your_database_user',
           'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
           'HOST': 'your_database_host', 
           'PORT': '3306', 
       }
   }
   ```

* **Connect to the Backend:** In the `flask_api.py` file, replace  `'http://your_backend_url'` with the actual URL of your running Flask backend (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).


* **Run Database Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

* **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Your Django development server will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
